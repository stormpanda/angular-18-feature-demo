# Angular18FeatureDemo

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.7.

## What's to see here?

This is just a small application that highlights some of the new features of Angular 17 / 18. This is only meant for training purposes and is not supposed to follow any best practices, but just for quickly showing examples.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

It is using SSR. Feel free to experiment with disabling JavaScript and also with using SPA navigation vs. reloading the page to see the different behaviors. Also look at the console, as some examples log something there.
